#Search Template#

The BYU-Idaho search template is set up to use gulp to update the header and footer to the latest version in the responsive-prototype repository.  To update the template with a new version of the header and footer you must have node.js installed, then navigate to the directory and run these commands.

*npm install
*gulp

This will generate the template-compiles.xsl file which can then be uploaded into the google search appliance.
